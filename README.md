# **AI & Machine Learning for Smart Contract Auditing**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ AI-Powered Decompilers for Reconstructing Solidity**  

### **Problem:**  
Many smart contracts are deployed on the blockchain as **bytecode**, making manual audits difficult when the original Solidity code is unavailable.  

### **AI Solution:**  
- AI-powered **Solidity decompilers** reconstruct human-readable code from compiled **Ethereum bytecode**.  
- This allows auditors to analyze smart contracts **even without source code**.  

### **Example ‚Äì Bytecode to Solidity Decompilation with AI**  
Using **ethervm.io's decompiler** or similar AI-based tools, we can reconstruct Solidity from bytecode.  

#### **Python Implementation using Etherscan API & AI Model**  
```python
import requests

# Etherscan API Key (replace with your own)
API_KEY = "YOUR_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY"
contract_address = "0xContractAddress"

# Fetch contract bytecode from Etherscan
url = f"https://api.etherscan.io/api?module=contract&action=getsourcecode&address={contract_address}&apikey={API_KEY}"
response = requests.get(url).json()

bytecode = response['result'][0]['SourceCode']
print("Contract Bytecode:", bytecode)

# AI-powered decompiler can process this bytecode into Solidity
# Example: Using AI model to reconstruct Solidity (Hypothetical function)
def ai_decompile(bytecode):
    return "Reconstructed Solidity Code"

solidity_code = ai_decompile(bytecode)
print(solidity_code)
```
üí° **Real-World Impact:** AI-based decompilers **reverse-engineer** contracts for security analysis, even when source code is hidden.

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Building an AI Model to Predict Contract Vulnerabilities**  

### **Problem:**  
- Manual audits are time-consuming.  
- AI can **analyze thousands of contracts** quickly to find vulnerabilities.  

### **Solution:**  
- Train a **machine learning model** using **labeled datasets** of smart contracts with known vulnerabilities.  

### **Example ‚Äì Using NLP & Machine Learning to Detect Vulnerabilities**  
We train an **ML model** using a dataset of **Solidity smart contracts** with labels (e.g., `vulnerable` or `secure`).  

#### **Python Implementation ‚Äì Preprocessing Solidity Code for AI Training**  
```python
import re
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

# Load dataset of Solidity contracts
data = pd.read_csv("smart_contracts_dataset.csv")

# Preprocessing function (removes comments, extra spaces, etc.)
def preprocess_code(code):
    code = re.sub(r"//.*|/\*.*?\*/", "", code, flags=re.DOTALL)  # Remove comments
    return code.strip()

data['clean_code'] = data['contract_code'].apply(preprocess_code)

# Convert contracts into numerical format for training
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(data['clean_code'])

print("Feature Matrix Shape:", X.shape)
```
üí° **Key Takeaway:** AI models **learn patterns in Solidity code** to predict vulnerabilities before deployment.

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Automating Exploit Detection with Deep Learning**  

### **Problem:**  
- Exploits like **reentrancy**, **integer overflow**, and **front-running** are complex and difficult to detect manually.  

### **Solution:**  
- **Deep Learning** models can analyze **contract execution traces** and detect patterns of exploitation.  

### **Example ‚Äì Using AI to Detect Reentrancy Bugs**  
A **neural network** can classify Solidity functions as **vulnerable** or **secure** based on execution behavior.  

#### **Python Implementation ‚Äì Simple Neural Network for Reentrancy Detection**  
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# Sample contract execution dataset (X: contract features, Y: labels)
X_train = [[1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]
Y_train = [1, 0, 1, 0]  # 1: Vulnerable, 0: Secure

# Build AI model
model = Sequential([
    Dense(16, activation='relu', input_shape=(3,)),
    Dense(8, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_train, Y_train, epochs=10)

print("Model Trained! Ready to Predict Reentrancy Issues.")
```
üí° **Key Takeaway:** AI **automates vulnerability detection**, making audits **faster and more reliable**.
